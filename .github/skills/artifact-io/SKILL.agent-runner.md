  Artifact I/O conventions and directory structure for multi-agent workflows. Use this skill when an agent needs to read or write workflow artifacts, understand the CHANGE-ID directory structure, or determine correct file paths for inputs and outputs. Provides: (1) Artifact root convention — {{artifact_root}}{CHANGE-ID}/ as the base path for all workflow artifacts, (2) Standard directory structure — intake/, planning/, execution/, qa/, summary/, logs/ with defined purposes, (3) Read/write permission model — which paths each agent role may access, (4) CHANGE-ID templating — how to construct artifact paths using the change identifier. Keywords: artifact root, CHANGE-ID, directory structure, intake, planning, execution, qa, summary, logs, artifact path, workflow artifacts, read write permissions, file path conventions.

## Dynamic context to inject

Use Claude Code's `!` pre-execution syntax when you need to resolve the active change identifier from the local workflow state instead of leaving `{CHANGE-ID}` abstract.

```text
!`cat .current-change-id 2>/dev/null || echo 'no active CHANGE-ID'`
```

Use the injected value to replace the placeholder when the workflow has already established an active change.

# Artifact I/O & Directory Conventions

Standard conventions for reading and writing workflow artifacts in multi-agent systems.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:

- An agent needs to determine where to read input artifacts
- An agent needs to determine where to write output artifacts
- Setting up artifact directory paths for a new workflow stage
- Understanding the permission model for artifact access
- Constructing file paths with CHANGE-ID templating

## Artifact Root

All workflow artifacts live under a single root, separate from the code repository:

```
{{artifact_root}}{CHANGE-ID}/
```

- `{{artifact_root}}` is configured at workflow start (typically an Obsidian vault or similar)
- `{CHANGE-ID}` is the unique identifier for the current workflow run
- This root is separate from `code_repo` — it holds documentation, not source code

## Permission Model

### By Agent Role

| Agent Role               | May Read                                                                                | May Write                                                                                                                  |

| **QA Engineer**          | All artifacts (read-only), `code_repo` (read-only)                                      | `qa/*`, `logs/qa/`                                                                                                         |

| **Information Explorer** | `agent-context/knowledge/*`, repo docs, web                                             | `logs/information_explorer/`                                                                                               |

### Universal Permissions

All agents may:

- **Read** artifacts relevant to their stage
- **Write** to `agent-context/lessons.md` (append-only)
- **Write** to their designated log directory

All agents MUST NOT:

- Write outside their designated paths
- Modify artifacts from other stages (read-only)
- Access credentials or environment files

## Path Construction

### Pattern

```
{artifact_root}{CHANGE-ID}/{stage}/{filename}
```

### Examples

```yaml
# Intake artifacts
input: "{CHANGE-ID}/intake/story.yaml"
input: "{CHANGE-ID}/intake/constraints.md"

# Planning artifacts
output: "{CHANGE-ID}/planning/tasks.yaml"
output: "{CHANGE-ID}/planning/assignments.json"

# Execution artifacts (per UoW)
output: "{CHANGE-ID}/execution/UOW-001/impl_report.yaml"

# QA artifacts
output: "{CHANGE-ID}/qa/qa_report.yaml"

# Evaluation artifacts (k = attempt number)
output: "{CHANGE-ID}/planning/eval_tasks_1.json"
output: "{CHANGE-ID}/execution/UOW-001/eval_impl_2.json"

# Log artifacts
output: "{CHANGE-ID}/logs/task_generator/20260127_143500_session.json"
```

## Knowledge Directory (Separate)

Knowledge files are NOT under `{CHANGE-ID}/` — they persist across workflow runs:

```
agent-context/knowledge/
├── accumulated-knowledge.md
├── learnings.json
├── information-index.json
├── questions.json
├── standing-questions.md
└── rls-system-architecture.md
```

Access to these files is managed exclusively through the Reference Librarian.

---

## Automated Scaffold Script

Use `~/.github/scripts/init-artifact-dirs.py` to create the standard artifact directory tree:

```bash
~/.github/scripts/init-artifact-dirs.py <artifact_root> <CHANGE-ID>
```

**When to use**: At the start of any workflow, before writing any artifacts. This replaces manual `mkdir -p` commands.

**Output**: JSON to stdout with `status`, `artifact_root`, `change_id`, `directories_created`.

**Exit codes**: 0 = success, 2 = usage error.
